This is the mediafire link for the Video-Player program installer in case anyone wants to see it.

I passed it in a link since since I am new to GitHub I did not know how to do it since the zip was too 
heavy and I could not upload everything. The node-modules folder is also missing, so you will need to 
create it and download the libraries in the package-lock.json so that this can work correctly for you.
